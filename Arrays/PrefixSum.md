### Count all sub-arrays having sum divisible by k

Consider the subarray sum equals K problem. Here, we need to find let's say a right pointer R and a left pointer L which forms a subarray from L to R[inclusive] whose sum equals K. I.e,

sum[R] - sum[L-1] = K -> (sum of subarray upto R) - (sum of subarray upto L) = K

Now, building on top of that for this problem, what happens when we take MOD K throughout the above equation.

(sum[R] - sum[L-1]) MOD K = (n * K) MOD K -- Here, I've introduced another number n (>=0) as we require sum to be a multiple of K
sum[R] MOD K - sum[L-1] MOD K = 0
sum[R] MOD K = sum[L-1] MOD K
If ends up to find prefix sums whose MOD K are equal. We just need to keep doing prefix sums MOD K as we iterate from one end of the array to another and 
keep a track of what we have found till now. Whenever we encounter a prefix sum whose MOD K was already found, then that means we found two prefix sums satisfying Equation 3 above. That's it!! We are DONE.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& A, int K) {

        int pref = 0; // prefix sum
        vector<int> cPref(K); //sum will not exceed K as we are taking modulo at every step
        cPref[pref]++; // adding 0 as prefix sum, base case
        
        int answer = 0; // count of number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by K
        
        for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
            
            pref = (pref + A[i]) % K; // Here, we take modulo of prefix sum as outlined in the explanation
            
            if(pref < 0) pref += K; // since -1 mod 5 and 4 mod 5 are equivalent, we will keep only positives since we like them :)
                        
            answer += cPref[pref]; // if we have already found pref, then increase the answer count
            
            cPref[pref]++; // add pref seen count by 1
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```
